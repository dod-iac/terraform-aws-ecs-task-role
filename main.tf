/**
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Creates an IAM role for use as an ECS task role.
 *
 * ```hcl
 * module "ecs_task_role" {
 *   source = "dod-iac/ecs-task-role/aws"
 *
 *   name = format("app-%s-task-role-%s", var.application, var.environment)
 *
 *   tags  = {
 *     Application = var.application
 *     Environment = var.environment
 *     Automation  = "Terraform"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Testing
 *
 * Run all terratest tests using the `terratest` script.  If using `aws-vault`, you could use `aws-vault exec $AWS_PROFILE -- terratest`.  The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is required by the tests.  Use `TT_SKIP_DESTROY=1` to not destroy the infrastructure created during the tests.  Use `TT_VERBOSE=1` to log all tests as they are run.  The go test command can be executed directly, too.
 *
 * ## Terraform Version
 *
 * Terraform 0.13. Pin module version to ~> 1.0.0 . Submit pull-requests to main branch.
 *
 * Terraform 0.11 and 0.12 are not supported.
